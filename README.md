# 🌤️ Feel the Day

**🚀 A weather app that helps you _feel the day_ by comparing today’s temperature to yesterday’s.**
Instead of just number, it gives you an intuitive sense of how the day feels — so you can decide what to wear without overthinking.

We make weather-based decisions every day — but numbers alone don’t help us decide what to wear.
“Feel the Day” closes that gap by grounding weather in personal experience. You know what yesterday felt like — now you can use that to sense today.

> You remember how yesterday felt — now you know how today compares.
